Usage
-----

To use this extension, you have to configure the Connection class in your application configuration:

```php
//configure component:
return [
    //....
    'components' => [
        'image' => [
            'class' => 'yii2mod\image\ImageComponent',
        ],
    ]
];

//add behavior to the model 
public function behaviors()
    {
        return [
            'image' => [
                'class' => ImageBehavior::className(),
                'pathAttribute' => 'path'
            ],
        ];
    }
    
// add image action to SiteController
public function actions()
{
    return [
        'image' => 'yii2mod\image\actions\ImageAction'
    ];
}
 
```
Usage example:
```php
$imageModel->url('home'); // home is the type of photo, depending on type resize/crop/watermark/etc actions will happen
```

```php
'params' => [
        .....
        'image' => [
            'medium' => [
                'thumbnail' => [
                    'box' => [194, 194],
                    'mode' => 'outbound'
                ],
                'visible' => 'user' //checking role before outputing url
            ],
            'home' => [
                'thumbnail' => [
                    'box' => [640, 480],
                    'mode' => 'inset'
                ],
                'watermark' => [
                    'watermarkFilename' => '@app/web/images/watermark.png'
